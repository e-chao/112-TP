AimPy

This is an aim trainer using 3D graphics and pygame. You will click the targets (default color being yellow) to gain a high score within 60 seconds. After the time runs out, you will be sent to a game over screen that gives you a performance report with your score, accuracy, and things to work on! More info can be found by clicking the help button in the main menu.

Open up main.py and then run the program from there once you've downloaded the zip and extracted it. You will need Pygame installed for this to work. 

You can use the escape key to navigate between escape and help menus. It will also pause the game if you are currently playing it.

When making inputs in settings, sensitivity must be in float form i.e(x.xx), colors must be 3 numbers between 0 and 255 without parenthesis, for example, 200,200,200 (again, no parenthesis), and radius must be a number (you probably shouldn't play with this one too much otherwise you'll either have no crosshair or have the whole screen be covered). After you have what you want to be inputted ready, just click outside the textbox for it to register and change.

Have fun!
